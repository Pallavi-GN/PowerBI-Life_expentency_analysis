# Life_expentency_analysis using PowerBI 

## Introduction
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing life expectancy data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The dataset includes various health-related indicators for different countries over several years.

## Data Sources
Life_expectancy_Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis "Life Expectancy Data.csv" .

## Data Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

1.Country: The name of the country.

2.Year: The year for which the data is recorded.

3.Status: The status of the country (Developing or Developed).

4.Life Expectancy: The average number of years a person can expect to live.

5.Adult Mortality: The probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population.

6.Infant Deaths: The number of infant deaths per 1000 live births.

7.Alcohol: The average alcohol consumption per capita.

8.Percentage Expenditure: Expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP.

9.Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B immunization coverage among 1-year-olds.

10.Measles: Number of reported measles cases per 1000 population.

11.BMI (Body Mass Index): The average BMI of the population.

12.Under-Five Deaths: Number of deaths under five years of age per 1000 live births.

13.Polio: Polio immunization coverage among 1-year-olds.

14.Total Expenditure: General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure.

15.Diphtheria: Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds.

16.HIV/AIDS: Deaths per 1,000 live births from HIV/AIDS.

17.GDP: Gross Domestic Product.

18.Population: Total population of the country.

19.Thinness 1-19 Years: Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents for age group 1-19.

20.Thinness 5-9 Years: Prevalence of thinness among children for age group 5-9.

21.Income Composition of Resources: Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources.

22.Schooling: Average number of years of schooling.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1.Data loading and inspection.

2.Handling missing values.

3.Data cleaning and formatting.

## Insights

Analysis can be performed on factors influencing life expectancy and health outcomes.
Trends over the years and differences between developing and developed countries can be explored.
This overview provides a general understanding of the dataset, and further analysis can be conducted based on specific research questions or objectives.
